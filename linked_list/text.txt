Single Link list
    Resembles a head(node) and pointer(tail) that points to the next head


Double Link list
    Resembles nodes that points to the next node and points to the previous node as well

Circular Linked list
    Head and Tail nodes points to each other

Advantage:
    Sequantial access
    Adding, removing adds anywhere into the RAM and change pointers to fit to the linked list
    Where, arrays needs to free/move elements in memory to make space 

Disadvantage:
    No direct access to elements, must traverse elments
