Hashtables 

Generated values are stored in buckets

Advantages:
    - Extremely fast
        - access
        - insert
        - removing values

Hashing passwords
 - password taken by a hash function that maps characters to letter & numbers
 - irreversible
 - consistent => same input, same output
 - collision => two different input gives the same output
