Binary Tree
    Each Node has a maximum of 2 children left & right

Binary Search Tree
    Type of binary tree that naturally stays sorted
    As the following rule applies:
        Left child always less than it's parent
        Right child always more that it's parent

    Perfect Tree: Same amount of nodes on both sides (rare)
    Balanced: Roughly the same amount of nodes
    Unbalanced: De difference between sides are obvious
    Degenerate tree: linked list...,

Advantage:
    Extremely fast for:
        Inserting elements
        Deleting elements
        Accessing elements
        Even at large database sizes
